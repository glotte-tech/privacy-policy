  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 8, 2025</p>

  <p>[Your App Name] (“we”, “our”, “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
  explains how our mobile application handles information.</p>

  <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
  <p>
    Our app bundle requests the <strong>Camera</strong> permission because some third-party
    libraries may include it. However, the app itself does <em>not</em> use the camera directly.
    - We do not capture photos or videos. <br/>
    - We do not upload or share any camera data. <br/>
    - This permission exists only because of certain bundled libraries.
  </p>

  <h2>Other Permissions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong>: Used only for voice and audio features you initiate.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong>: Used only if required by app functionality (e.g., [adjust with your actual use]).</li>
    <li><strong>Storage</strong>: May be used to save or access files locally on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet</strong>: Required to connect to our backend services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    We do not collect, store, or share personal data such as photos, videos, or contact lists.
    Any information processed by the app remains on your device unless explicitly shared by you.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not directed to children under 13/16, and we do not knowingly collect
    personal information from children.
  </p>
